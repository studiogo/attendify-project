# Project Brief: Attendify

## 1. Core Problem

Organizers of webinars struggle with low attendance rates compared to the number of sign-ups. There's a lack of effective tools to engage registered participants *before* the event.

## 2. Proposed Solution

Attendify (https://attendify.pl) is a web-based SaaS application designed to provide organizers with tools to increase engagement and attendance for their webinars.

## 3. High-Level Goals

*   Increase webinar attendance rates for Attendify users.
*   Provide easy-to-use tools for participant engagement.
*   Build a modular platform for future feature expansion.

## 4. Initial Focus (Phase 1)

*   User registration and login for organizers.
*   CRUD operations for webinar events.
*   Automatic generation of an embeddable `<iframe>` widget for each event.
*   The iframe will display event details and "Add to Calendar" buttons (Google, Outlook, Apple via .ics).
*   Basic iframe customization (colors, optional logo).
*   Detailed statistics on "Add to Calendar" button interactions within the iframe.
