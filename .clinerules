# Cline's Learning Journal for Attendify Project

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively.

## Project-Specific Patterns

*   The project follows a modular monolith architecture.
*   The backend exposes a RESTful API at https://attendify.pl/api/....
*   Iframe interactions are stateless and based on public\_id.

## Tool Usage Patterns

*   `write_to_file` is used for creating new files and initializing the memory bank.
*   `replace_in_file` will be used for making targeted edits to existing files.

## Known Challenges

*   Ensuring GDPR compliance when logging IP addresses in `widget_interactions`.
*   Optimizing the performance of click tracking in the `/track` endpoint.
